The Flying Luttenbachers
The Flying Luttenbachers are an American instrumental unit led by multiinstrumentalist  composer  producer Weasel Walter The Luttenbachers have created a body of work focused on musical extremity and dissonance Over the course of the band the personnel has shifted numerous times around the artistic leadership of Walter The music has run a gamut from intense allacoustic free improvisation to complex modernistic rock composition electronic noise to punkinspired jazz Walter has been quoted as drawing inspiration from the fields of punk death metal free jazz and no wave

The Flying Luttenbachers formed in December 1991 in Chicago Illinois as a punk jazz trio with Hal Russell tenor and soprano saxophones trumpet Chad Organ tenor saxophone and Weasel Walter drums The band derived their moniker from Russells birthname Harold Luttenbacher Russell left the band in June 1992 and was soon replaced by Ken Vandermark for the recording of the Flying Luttenbachers first 7 record

The band has since featured a frequently shifting cast of free jazz and experimental rock musicians including Fred LonbergHolm Kurt Johnson Jeb Bishop Alex Perkolup Mick Barr Ed Rodriguez Mike Green and Jonathan Hischke The Flying Luttenbachers have toured Europe and the US extensively with bands like The Locust Arab On Radar Lightning Bolt US Maple Erase Errata Bobby Conn and Wolf Eyes Walter moved from Chicago to Oakland California in 2003 beginning yet another incarnation of the group The live band played their final concert in November 2006 The Flying Luttenbachers project officially ceased operation in November 2007 upon the release of a final studio album recorded solo by Walter

In 2017 the band reformed for a tour in France invited by the Sonic Protest festival The newest incarnation of the group appeared opening 3 shows for Oh Sees at Warsaw in Brooklyn NY on October 1719

Since 1996s Revenge album the Flying Luttenbachers musical output has been underlined by a gradually unravelling storyline concerning the selfobliteration of the planet Earth and the resulting aftermath The 2006 album Cataclysm concerns an interstellar battle between two monolithic entities The Void a dark silent spectre detailed on 2004s album of the same name and The Iridescent Behemoth a massive planetoid being whose tale was told on 2003s complex Systems Emerge From Complete Disorder album The music energetically utilizes deliberate harmonic dissonance and the material operates on a principle of intelligent transformation of concise amounts of interrelated themes
